## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- `scripts/supersplat-dl.sh` — download any SuperSplat scene as a tortuise-compatible PLY in one command
- GitHub Actions CI (build, test, clippy, fmt on macOS + Linux)
- CONTRIBUTING.md and CHANGELOG.md

### Fixed
- Camera init restored to proven `(0,0,5)` at origin; all AABB/scene-center heuristics removed
- Orbit mode always targets origin; WASD no longer shifts the orbit center
- Crate package excludes large scene files and binary assets

### Changed
- Demo image switched from GIF (9.3 MB) to animated WebP (4.4 MB)
- README tagline, intro, and "Why this exists" section rewritten for clarity

- Perceptual grayscale matching for 256-color environments

- Clap CLI with `--flip-y` flag and graceful GPU-error degradation
